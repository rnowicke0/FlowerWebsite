I wanted to create an easy mock website for my first personal project.
I used HTML and CSS, no JavaScript as I'm still learning.
Challenges had to do with recalling responsive design elements and how to use them, along with brushing up on CSS after not using for a while.

Some things I'd like to improve on:
Organizing code, simplifying code, and learning more interactive design.
